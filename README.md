# Copy-to-hip
This HDA enables you to find textures and geometry files used across different nodes in the project <br>
copying them to the HIP directory and updating the path with new HIP reference.

File extensions that search: <br>
**Textures:** = `.jpg` `.jpeg` `.png` `.exr` `.hdr` <br>
**Geometry:** = `.obj` `.fbx` `.stl` `.abc`

**Important:** Make sure that the file has been saved before clicking "Copy to HIP", otherwise the file may be saved to a directory like 'C:\Users\USER'.
